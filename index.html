          Welcome! I'm glad you're here. <br><br>

          If you're looking to learn more about me - my experience, past projects, and future goals - you've come to the right place. <br><br>

          I've been dabbling in code for years now, but just recently decided to jump headfirst into it as a primary career path. 
          I'm highly analytical, very self-motivated, and love the way every coding project often feels like a puzzle with hundreds of correct solutions. 
          I am fearless and persistent in nature (it's no secret that coding is not for the easily deterred...), 
          as demonstrated by my past experience owning my own marketing company, and Iâ€™m confident ready to take on the next
          big challenge along my career path, wherever it leads me.<br>
